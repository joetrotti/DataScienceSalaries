# Salaries in the Data Science Field

This project shows the projected salary of employers in the data science field for large companies in the United States. A linear regession algorithm was used to calculate the projected salary in 2023 with data provided from 2020, 2021, and 2022. This data can be run on any operating system but the provided information below is based off a Windows device, which how our group processed the data.

2) For an acurate representation of the data pip was used, you can check this by typing `python --version` in the command prompt.

3) Once `datasciencesalaries.py` and `ds_salaries_worklevel.csv` are donwloaded to your device, you will need to change the path of the file to when you saved it. For example my path is: `E:\\School\\DataScience\\DataScienceSalaries\\ds_salaries_worklevel.csv')`
